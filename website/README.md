# Premake Website

Premake website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```
npm install
```

## Local Development

```
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

To see a list of broken links (mistakes happen!), be sure to run `npm run build` before submitting updates.

## Build

```
npm run-script build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
